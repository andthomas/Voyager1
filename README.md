# Voyager1

Live version: https://andthomas.github.io/Voyager1/

Voyager 1 was launched on the 5th of September 1977. It is currently the farthest man made object from planet Earth. Each Earth year, it travels approximately 500,000,000km. It carries with it a message from the human race to any extraterrestrial who may find it. The entire project it truly incredible and easily captures the imagination of any buddying astronaut.

The project was built with Three.js. Flight trajectory data for Voyager 1 was obtained from NASA's Space Physics Data Facility. I would like to say a big thank you to Bob Mcguire for his assistance in understanding fluctuations in the heliocentric data. The model of the Voyager 1 craft was also obtained from NASA, built in Blender and converted into a JSON object. The planets were obtianed from threes.planets.js.

The model is to scale by default, but this can be altered by way of the Dat Gui controller in the top right corner.
